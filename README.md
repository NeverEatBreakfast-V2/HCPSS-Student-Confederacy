# HCPSS-Student-Confederacy
The HCPSS Student Confederacy is a dedicated coalition of students from Howard County, united in their mission to challenge the recent phone ban within the Howard County Public School System. This group believes in the importance of technology as an educational tool and aims to advocate for students' rights to use their phones responsibly during school hours. Through peaceful protests, organized walkouts, and creative community engagement, the Confederacy aims to raise awareness about the issue and encourage dialogue with school administrators and decision-makers. By promoting collaboration and activism, the HCPSS Student Confederacy strives to create an open and equitable educational environment where all students can communicate and thrive without unnecessary restrictions.

# If none of these works...
If none of these actions yield results, the Student Confederacy will assess the situation within a week to see if HoCo reverses its decision. If the Confederacy is disbanded, it will be the end of our efforts. However, if the policy remains in place, we will extend an invitation to those who wish to participate, while leaving the neutral individuals alone.

If the policy is upheld, our plan is straightforward: we will organize a learning strike, where all members will refuse to attend school and will actively promote our cause. Once a sufficient number of people join us, we will politely request that Howard County reconsider their decision. If they refuse again, we will take further action by protesting outside schools, holding signs to advocate for our rights and freedoms. We have the right to petition and the right to assembly as well as protest as stated within the constitution. 

If our American freedoms and liberties are disregarded, our next step will be to reach out to Donald Trump using the contact link, as well as other government officials who may be willing to listen to our concerns.

# About the leaders
We are the leaders of the Howard County Public School System (HCPSS) Student Confederacy, operating anonymously as Cella and Brandon. We founded the Confederacy on February 7th, fueled by our frustration with the county's phone ban policy, which we believed unfairly restricted our rights and hindered our education.

Recognizing the need for change, we gathered like-minded students to form a group that would amplify our voices. Through discussions, social media campaigns, and outreach efforts, we worked to raise awareness and advocate for our rights. Our mission extends beyond the phone ban; we aim to create a culture where student input is valued in decision-making.

As we move forward, we are dedicated to uniting students and promoting open dialogue. Together, we believe we can make a significant impact in our school communities and ensure our voices are heard. While we may remain anonymous, our commitment to advocacy and change drives us every step of the way.
