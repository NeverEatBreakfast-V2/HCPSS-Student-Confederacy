Wave 2, we will now await for the phone ban, all higher ranking members or any original confederacy members from Virginia (Yeah, we convinced a few Virginians to join us.) will be 
given a walkie talkie for communication, (5 mile radius sadly, so around 10 mile diameter isn't that bad but still.)


Hopefully, we will communicate and recruit. 

We will go on our learning strike and we've already talked to a few of our members that will host walk outs,

1. River Hill
2. Reservoir
3. Atholton
4. Centennial
5. Murray Hill (Their a middle school but they want to advocate for their rights so.... Let them in i guess?)
